* Let's improve the package management
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (org-babel-load-file
     (expand-file-name
      "package-management.org"
      user-emacs-directory))
  #+end_src

* Better keybindings
  I want VIM keybindings. So before we install anything else
  let's get that set up and any other keybinding support.

** Evil mode
  This will give us VIM keybindings.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package evil
      :init
      (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
      (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t)
      (setq evil-want-C-w-in-emacs-state t)
      (setq evil-search-module 'evil-search)
      (setq evil-vsplit-window-right t)
      (setq evil-split-window-below t)
      :config
      (evil-mode 1))

    (use-package evil-collection
      :after
      evil
      :config
      (evil-collection-init)
      )
  #+end_src

** General and Hydra
   This is a much better way of setting keybindings.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package general
       :config
       (general-create-definer wb/leader-keys
         :keymaps '(normal insert visual emacs)
         :prefix "SPC"
         :global-prefix "C-SPC"
         )
       (wb/leader-keys
         "b" '(switch-to-buffer :which-key "buffer-switch")
         "f" '(find-file :which-key "find-file")
         "g" '(keyboard-quit :which-key "quit"))
       )

     (use-package hydra)
   #+end_src

* Better Base Emacs Defaults
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
